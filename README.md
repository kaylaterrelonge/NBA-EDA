The following project is an in-depth analysis of NBA player performance focused on how the COVID-19 pandemic influenced player performance, given the specific pandemic related policies implemented during that time. This project utilized web-scraping techniques to collect and aggregate the primary player data and the secondary coaching data. From here, various graphics were created to unpack particular trends observed in player performance and to offer reasoning for why these trends changed during the pandemic and after the pandemic.
